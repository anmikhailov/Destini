## About this app
This is a “choose your own adventure” game similar to the App Store hit “Life Line” app. The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience. In this app I use:
* UIKit/Storyboard.
* Model-View-Controller or MVC pattern for app development.
* Swift structures and functions with outputs.
